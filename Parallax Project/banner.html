					<h1>Adventure Time</h1>
					<div class="introInfo">
						<p>Adventure Time follows the adventures of a boy named Finn the Human,
							and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake the Dog, who has magical
							powers to change shape and size at will. Pendleton Ward, the series' creator, describes Finn
							as a "fiery little kid with strong morals". Jake, on the other hand, is based on Tripper
							Harrison, Bill Murray's character in Meatballs. This means that while Jake is somewhat
							carefree, he will "sit [Finn] down and give him some decent advice if he really needs
							it". Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, which was ravaged by a
							cataclysmic event known as the "Mushroom War", a nuclear war that destroyed civilization a
							thousand years before the series' events. Throughout the series, Finn and Jake interact with
							major characters, including Princess Bubblegum, the sovereign of the Candy
							Kingdom and a sentient piece of gum; the Ice King, a menacing but largely
							misunderstood ice wizard; Marceline the Vampire Queen, a thousand-year-old
							vampire and rock music enthusiast; Lumpy Space Princess, a melodramatic and
							immature princess made out of "lumps"; BMO, a sentient video game console-shaped
							robot that lives with Finn and Jake; and Flame Princess, a flame elemental
							and ruler of the Fire Kingdom.</p>
